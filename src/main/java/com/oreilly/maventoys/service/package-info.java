/**
 * Services for managing different aspects of the business domain within the application.
 * This includes operations for categories, employees, products, sales, and stores.
 * Each service class encapsulates the business logic for its respective domain,
 * interfacing with the necessary repositories and using DTOs for data transfer.
 *
 * <p>The service layer serves as a separation between the controllers (presentation layer)
 * and the repositories (data access layer), ensuring that business rules are adhered to
 * and that transactions are carried out in a consistent manner.</p>
 *
 * <p>Services in this package are marked with {@link org.springframework.stereotype.Service}
 * to designate them as components automatically detected by Spring's component-scanning mechanism.</p>
 *
 * <p>Exception handling is centralized within these services to provide a consistent
 * approach to error management across the application.</p>
