/**
 * This package contains specifications for the entities in the application.
 * <p>
 * Specifications are used to add additional constraints to a CriteriaQuery for entities.
 * They are typically used in the service layer to filter results based on certain criteria.
 * Each entity has its own specification class that implements the Specification interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, the CategorySpec class is used to filter Category entities based on their id and name.
